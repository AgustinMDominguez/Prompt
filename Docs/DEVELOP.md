# Run

In order to test the API without resending the same requests constantly, it is best to use a Jupyter notebook:

See the [`workshop.ipynb`](src/workshop.ipynb) file

# Code Style

To have a coding standard we use a slighly modified version of PEP8. To check if edited or created code passes the standard, run:

`pycodestyle . --exclude=venv/*,**ignore* --max-line-length=100`

# Commits Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commits structure
